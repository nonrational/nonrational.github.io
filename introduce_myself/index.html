       <h1>Introduce Myself</h1>
<blockquote>To whom wants to know me</blockquote>
<br>
<p>hi, there</p>
<br>
<p>I'm just a common guy you could pass by and never meet again.</p>
<br>
<p>You can call me yuxin or o1chi as you like, both the nicknames of mine.</p>
<br>
<p>I live near a lake, the same name as the town. I feel satisfied here, although part of myself wish I could go outside to explore the world.</p>
<br>
<p>Now, I am waiting for the result of the postgraduate test.</p>
<br>
<p>I desire to enjoy the arts, like novels, movies, games, in their original languages. So learning these languages becomes a life course for me.</p>
<br>
<p>I am still looking for two things, one is my girl, the other is the career I'll live for. The rest of my current life seems no matter.</p>
<br>
<p>A blog system tool named Miyano for Bear App is my first work, you can check it on Github.</p>
<br>
<p>I am a little fan of ACGN and Porn.</p>
<br>
<p>Send private message to me (@o1chi) at Telegram. </p>
<br>
<p>Play with me (ID: WUUSN) at Steam.</p>
<br>
<p>Let's have fun!</p>
